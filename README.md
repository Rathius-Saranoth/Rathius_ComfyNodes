# Flailing Noises

Just me failing at both making and understanding how to do this. I'm slowly learning Python, but this playground should help from a practical perspective.

I finally got the first node working with a lot of back and forth on lack of documentation and help from AI Assistants explaining things to me.

For example, the first node is simply a text loader. Pick and choose the text file you want to use as an input. For me this is so I don't have to copy/paste large descriptions. Instead I can parse them programatically, use them whole, or even concatonate them with other nodes. All without having to mess with the source material and/or ccidentally wiping out previous prompts, pieces, or tweaks.

## Future thoughts(?)
I'm hoping to make a personal repository of quality of life type nodes for ComfyUI that make me scratch my head at why the don't exist in the base program.
